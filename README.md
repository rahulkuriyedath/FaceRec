# FaceRec

This code allows you to recognizes faces in video streams. An application of this code could be in security cameras; the code could identify people as belonging to predefined "red-list" or "green-list". It could automatically warn the control team if a person listed in the redlist is found in the video stream.

### Libraries used

The face recognition is done using the `face_recognition` library in python. OpenCV has also been used in the code to handle images and videos.
